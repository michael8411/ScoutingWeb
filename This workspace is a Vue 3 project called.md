## Project Overview
This repository contains the **Scouting Webapp**, a Vue.js 3 application focused on providing a modular and reusable design system for various UI components. Originally, core components (like the `Button`) were implemented in React using **Framer Motion** for animations. The major objective is to migrate these components to Vue.js 3, leveraging **Oku Motion** for motion effects.

Key points include:
- Maintaining or improving upon existing functionality.
- Preserving consistent UI/UX.
- Utilizing the Vue Composition API for cleaner, more efficient code.
- Ensuring the migration avoids performance pitfalls.

## Project Goal
- **Primary Objective:** Migrate a reusable button component from **React** (with Framer Motion) to **Vue.js 3**, incorporating **Oku Motion** for animation.
- **Secondary Objectives:**
  - Adhere to Vue.js best practices.
  - Preserve or enhance the original look, feel, and interactivity.
  - Maintain or improve performance and responsiveness.

## Key Instructions & Features

### Analyzing the Existing React Component
1. **Review the React codebase** for the button component.
2. **Document** all props, events, styling hooks, and motion properties.
3. **Identify** how Framer Motion is used, including transitions, keyframes, and gesture-based animations.

### Designing the Vue.js Button Component
1. **Composition API:** Write the logic in `setup()` functions for reactivity and to avoid large monolithic options blocks.
2. **Props and Events:** Replicate the React component’s props and events (e.g., `onClick`) in a Vue-friendly way (`@click` or `emit()`).
3. **Compatibility:** Ensure the new component integrates well with the rest of the Vue.js 3 application.

### Migrating Visual Styling
1. **CSS/SCSS**: Transfer the button’s styling, ensuring **scoped** styles where appropriate (to avoid naming collisions).
2. **Responsive Design**: Preserve breakpoints and layout structure from the original button design.
3. **CSS Variables or Utility Classes**: Consider extracting repeated styling patterns into global variables or utility classes.

### Incorporating Animations with Oku Motion
1. **Oku Motion Basics**: Install and configure **Oku Motion** to replicate or improve Framer Motion’s animations.
2. **Replace Motion Logic**: Migrate `FramerMotion` directives to `OkuMotion` equivalents.
3. **Test**: Ensure transitions and gestures produce the same or better effects when triggered by user interactions (hover, click, focus).

### Testing Component Functionality
1. **Unit Tests**: Validate that the button’s props, events, and animations behave as expected.
2. **Integration Tests**: Render the button in a parent component or a test page to confirm seamless integration.
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Check that all animations and interactions work correctly on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Documenting the Migration
1. **Usage Instructions**: How to import and use the new Vue-based button.
2. **API/Props**: Outline each prop, default values, and events.
3. **Comparison Report** (optional): Summarize differences between React + Framer Motion vs Vue + Oku Motion implementations.
4. **Performance Findings**: Note any improvements or special considerations discovered during testing.
